We seem to have been able to listen to music using pocketable devices for ages. It wasn't always from our smartphones, and we used to have dedicated MP3 players, Ipods, and Walkmans for on-the-go music listening. But it was something that people did, and it has been since Walkmans were popular in the 1980s. However, almost any phone nowadays allows you to install your favorite music streaming service and even save some tracks on its internal storage.
But if you're looking for something a little more powerful and advanced than just what comes with your modern smartphone. Then this article is a must-read for you.

I'm here with another curated selection of the popular Android apps to provide you with something that focuses entirely on music playback and streaming. Here are some of our top selections for the popular Android music player apps 2022. This is going to be an excellent one, with anything from simple music player apps or music streaming services that allow you to play your locally downloaded music and even apps that do both.

"I noticed many users comment, ‘I don't enjoy streaming my music over the internet, and I don't want any fancy features that will slow down my phone, take up valuable space or resources, or consume my valuable internet data extremely quickly." "All I need is something to play my Music files.’ that is why I also add offline or local music player apps as well in the list”


<b> #1 Spotify </b>

Spotify is continuously at the top of our popular music player app list, and for a valid reason: it is one of the best music streaming apps available right now.

I have so many good reviews about Spotify that it's difficult to keep them all straight. It's my favorite streaming service for a reason.
You can use the app to play locally stored music as well as stream music from the web, making it the only app most users would need on their phones.
Spotify is available in both free and paid versions and includes a bunch of features as well as simple but effective features such as an incredibly large library, amazing suggestions based on what you listen to and what's popular in your area, and support for podcasts, which very few music streaming apps include.

<b> #2 Muzio | Music Player - MP3 Player </b>

If Spotify isn't your thing, one of the most well-known alternatives to other branded apps like Apple Music and YouTube Music is "Music Player - MP3 Player" which might be a better fit.

Music Player - MP3 Player has undoubtedly more beautiful and modern UI and way more unique, powerful and advanced features than Spotify, YouTube Music, or any other music app. 

This app exceptionally enhances your music listening experience by multiple times. It allows users to listen to PODCASTS and AUDIOBOOKS as well.
Advance Equalizer and Sound Booster, Reverb Effect, CrossFade Support, and Music Virtualization, Themes, Screens, and Skins customization, Smart Music Cutter and Ringtone Maker, Intelligent Drive Mode, Smart Sleep Timer, Advanced Audio & Video Codec Supports (Play any audio or video file on the go), Smart Live Lyrics and Lyrics Auto Synchronization, LAST.FM Scrobber, Integrated YouTube Player, InBuilt Powerful Video Player (perfect MX player alternative), High-Resolution music playback and sound output,Missing Album Arts Download and many more useful features and tools are available for free in this app.
The only drawdown of this app is that it can only play music or video files that you already stored or downloaded on your android smartphone's local/internal storage. but still one of the most perfect music player alternatives for your default player or any other music player or media player apps. It offers both free and paid versions.

<b> #3 Deezer </b>

Another option is Deezer, which has a feature set extremely identical to Spotify, down to the number of features available in the Premium version, and it also has an ad-supported free version.

Both are relatively decent, with features such as downloads, suggestions, and a great collection of music and podcasts to choose from.
If you're looking for one of the best music player apps available, this could be a contender to Spotify and Muzio.

<b> #4 Tidal Music </b>

Tidal Music has an advantage that only a few other streaming services have: it offers lossless audio. It will face competition from none other than Spotify, which just announced the launch of Spotify HiFi.

Tidal Music pioneered the concept of streaming lossless music, and getting CD-quality music without owning CDs or downloading FLAC files is quite awesome. Once we get passed the lossless element of things, Tidal Music remains a tempting package with access to a supposedly 70 million music collection.

We believe it is one of the biggest music player apps on the market due to the lossless quality, which is ideal for audiophiles.

<b> #5 YouTube Music </b>

YouTube, the digital video network, is regarded as "the king of free apps" since it provides access to a massive library of media, including music.
However, YouTube Music, while employing the same platform like YouTube, is entirely different.

The biggest part of the YouTube name is that all of your favourite music from the past is carried over, so you can easily indulge in nostalgia. 
The premium tier nullifies advertisements and grants access to features such as background playback. 

The free version, however, leaves a few items to be desired, so if you aren't ready to pay, you should choose a different alternative from this list.

<b> #6 Musixmatch </b>

Musixmatch has long been a well-known app, not just because it functions as a standalone music player for playing back locally downloaded tracks, but also because it provides additional functionality to other apps.

It focuses on live lyrics and does an excellent job of it. It allows you to play locally downloaded music and displays the lyrics to whatever you're listening prominently.

Don't you have any locally downloaded or stored music? Then, using something called FloatingLyrics, you can use it to display live lyrics on apps like Spotify. It's one of the most versatile and excellent music player apps on the market.

<b> #7 Apple Music </b>

We're still amazed Apple made Apple Music available on Android after all these years. It's unquestionably among the best music player apps for Android. 
To gain access to this service, you must pay a monthly membership of $10 for an individual package, $5 for students, or $15 for a family plan, which allows you to share your subscription and Apple's massive music collection with up to six people.

It even has Apple's new lossless audio function, so with the correct hardware, you can enjoy high-quality audio with Apple Music on your Android phone.
Many people blindly promote Spotify to everyone else, but I tried Apple Music for a few months and found it to be a really attractive bundle as well.

<b> #8 iHeartRadio </b>

iHeartRadio is not your typical streaming app; instead, it focuses on streaming something a little different - radio stations!

In this regard, it is more akin to listening to AM or FM radio than to streaming music. So, if you prefer doing things the old-fashioned way, this is it. 
It is, as the name implies, a radio streaming app where users may listen to a variety of stations based on their unique preferences. It features radio shows, podcasts, news, and sporting events. AM and FM radio stations are also included.

The best part is that it is completely free!

<b> #9 Shuttle Music Player </b>

I have another alternative option for users who do not wish to listen to music online.
Shuttle Music Player is a good alternative to your default music player if you have locally downloaded music.
It doesn't get much easier (or, thankfully, any more complicated) than that. It has folder browsing, tag editing (for altering MP3 tags), and, most notably, Modern Design.

It keeps things simple and precise, which is why it's on this list of the popular music player apps for Android.

<b> #10 PowerAMP </b>

Last but not least PowerAMP. We couldn't do a music app roundup without mentioning Poweramp.

Poweramp is, well, an ugly duck when compared to the other apps on this list. But appearance isn't the point. The whole purpose of this app is to perform above its design.

It supports a variety of codecs, high-resolution audio when the device supports it, and inbuilt 64-bit processing, and that's only a sampling of the things Poweramp offers. It truly is that good.

If you can look past the app's basic UI and pay a one-time fee for the full version.

<b> Conclusion </b>

If you're into streaming, you can't go wrong with any of the big names.
Spotify and Apple Music provide a relatively similar list of features as well as costs.

Deezer and Tidal are also decent alternatives in this category, while iHeartRadio keeps things old school by letting you listen to actual radio stations.

Don't want to listen to your music online?

Then Muzio | Music Player - MP3 Player is a better choice compared to Musixmatch and Shuttle Music Player but they both are also excellent choices.
